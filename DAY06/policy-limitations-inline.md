# IAM Policy Limitations – Complete In-Depth Documentation

AWS Identity and Access Management enforces **strict limits** on how many policies can be attached, how large they can be, and where they can be used.
Understanding these limits is critical to avoid **permission sprawl, hidden access, and scaling issues**.

---

## 1. Types of IAM Policies (Foundation)

IAM supports **two main policy types**:

### 1) Managed Policies

* Created once
* Can be attached to **multiple users, groups, and roles**
* Reusable and scalable

### 2) Inline Policies

* Directly embedded into **one user, group, or role**
* **Cannot be reused**
* Tightly coupled to that identity

---

## 2. Managed Policy Limits (Default AWS Limits)

### A) Customer-Managed Policies

| Limit                  | Value                 |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| Policies per account   | **1,500**             |
| Policy size            | **6,144 characters**  |
| Versions per policy    | **5** (only 1 active) |
| Attachments per policy | **Unlimited**         |

Important points:

* Older versions must be deleted manually
* Exceeding 5 versions blocks updates
* Size includes JSON + whitespace

---

### B) AWS Managed Policies

| Aspect          | Details     |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| Created by AWS  | Yes         |
| Editable        | No          |
| Version control | AWS manages |
| Account limit   | Not counted |

Used for:

* Quick access
* Standard roles
* Baseline permissions

---

## 3. Inline Policy Limits (Very Important)

Inline policies have **stricter and more dangerous limitations**.

### Inline Policy Size Limit

| Policy Type   | Max Size             |
| ------------- | -------------------- |
| Inline policy | **2,048 characters** |

This is **one-third** of managed policy size.

---

### Inline Policy Count Limits

| Identity  | Max Inline Policies |
| --------- | ------------------- |
| IAM User  | **10**              |
| IAM Group | **10**              |
| IAM Role  | **10**              |

After this:

* You **cannot add more inline policies**
* Must delete or redesign permissions

---

## 4. Attachment Limits (Critical for Design)

### Managed Policy Attachments

| Identity  | Max Managed Policies |
| --------- | -------------------- |
| IAM User  | **10**               |
| IAM Group | **10**               |
| IAM Role  | **10**               |

Even if:

* Policies are small
* Policies are AWS-managed

The limit is still **10**.

---

## 5. Policy Evaluation Is NOT Limited by Count

Important concept:

> IAM does **not stop evaluating** because limits are reached.

If a user has:

* 10 managed policies
* 10 inline policies
* Group policies
* SCPs

AWS evaluates **all of them together**.

This causes:

* Unexpected allows
* Hard-to-trace access
* Security confusion

---

## 6. Inline Policies – Why They Are Dangerous

Inline policies:

* Are **hidden** inside the identity
* Cannot be reused
* Are easy to forget
* Bypass centralized review
* Increase audit complexity

If a user is deleted:

* Inline policies are deleted silently
* No record remains unless logged separately

---

## 7. Best Practice Rule (Very Important)

| Use Case             | Recommended Policy Type     |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Reusable permissions | Managed policy              |
| Standard access      | Managed policy              |
| Temporary exception  | Inline policy               |
| Break-glass access   | Inline policy (short-lived) |
| Organization control | SCP                         |

Inline policies should be **rare and intentional**.

---

## 8. Policy Size Limitation – Practical Impact

Because of size limits:

* Large policies must be split
* Conditions must be optimized
* Wildcards used carefully

Example problem:

* Adding IP + MFA + time + VPC conditions
* Inline policy hits 2 KB quickly
* Managed policy handles it safely

---

## 9. Inline vs Managed – Direct Comparison

| Aspect            | Inline Policy   | Managed Policy |
| ----------------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| Reusable          | No              | Yes            |
| Max size          | 2,048 chars     | 6,144 chars    |
| Max count         | 10 per identity | 10 attachments |
| Versioning        | No              | Yes            |
| Audit visibility  | Poor            | Good           |
| Deletion behavior | Auto-deleted    | Independent    |

---

## 10. Hidden Limitation Many Miss

### Groups + Inline Policies

If:

* Group has inline policy
* User inherits it

The inline policy:

* Is not visible at user level
* Still fully effective

This causes confusion during audits.

---

## 11. How Limits Affect Real Environments

Typical failure patterns:

* “Policy size exceeded” error
* “Maximum policies attached” error
* Permissions working unexpectedly
* Inline policies bypassing design rules

Root cause is usually **poor policy architecture**.

---

## 12. Scaling-Safe Policy Design Guidelines

* Prefer **managed policies**
* Keep inline policies minimal
* Separate:

  * Read
  * Write
  * Admin
* Use conditions sparingly
* Centralize policy ownership
* Regularly review credential report + policies

---

## 13. One Clear Statement

> “IAM policy limits are not just technical restrictions; they enforce good security design and prevent permission sprawl.”

---

## 14. Summary (Conceptual)

* Inline policies are **limited, hidden, and risky**
* Managed policies are **scalable and auditable**
* Size and count limits directly affect architecture
* AWS does not warn about bad design — it only enforces limits
